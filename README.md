![License.](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This module will introduce you to working with Microsoft Graph to access data in Office 365 by building a PHP web application.  This sample uses the Azure AD v2 authentication endpoint to access data in Office 365 using Microsoft Graph.

## Prerequisites

To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:
- Before you start this tutorial, you should have [PHP](http://php.net/downloads.php), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) installed on your development machine.
- Either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account.

If you don't have a Microsoft account, there are a couple of options to get a free account:

- You can [sign up for a new personal Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/signup?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1454618383&rver=6.4.6456.0&wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&wreply=https://mail.live.com/default.aspx&id=64855&cbcxt=mai&bk=1454618383&uiflavor=web&uaid=b213a65b4fdc484382b6622b3ecaa547&mkt=E-US&lc=1033&lic=1).
