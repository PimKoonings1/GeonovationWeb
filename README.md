![License.](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This module will introduce you to working with Microsoft Graph to access data in Office 365 by building PHP web applications.

## Prerequisites

To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:
- Before you start this tutorial, you should have [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your development machine.
- Either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account.

If you don't have a Microsoft account, there are a couple of options to get a free account:

- You can [sign up for a new personal Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/signup?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1454618383&rver=6.4.6456.0&wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&wreply=https://mail.live.com/default.aspx&id=64855&cbcxt=mai&bk=1454618383&uiflavor=web&uaid=b213a65b4fdc484382b6622b3ecaa547&mkt=E-US&lc=1033&lic=1).
- You can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Office 365 subscription.

## Register a web application with the Azure Active Directory admin center

1. Open a browser and navigate to the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com). Login using a **personal account** (aka: Microsoft Account) or **Work or School Account**.

1. Select **Azure Active Directory** in the left-hand navigation, then select **App registrations** under **Manage**.

1. Select **New registration**. On the **Register an application** page, set the values as follows.

    - Set **Name** to `ASP.NET Core Graph Tutorial`.
    - Set **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
    - Under **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Web` and set the value to `https://localhost:5001/`.

1. Select **Register**. On the **ASP.NET Core Graph Tutorial** page, copy the value of the **Application (client) ID** and save it, you will need it in the next step.

1. Select **Authentication** under **Manage**. Under **Redirect URIs** add a URI with the value `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`.

1. Set the **Logout URL** to `https://localhost:5001/signout-oidc`.

1. Locate the **Implicit grant** section and enable **ID tokens**. Select **Save**.

1. Select **Certificates & secrets** under **Manage**. Select the **New client secret** button. Enter a value in **Description** and select one of the options for **Expires** and select **Add**.
